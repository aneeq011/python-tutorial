# Practice Exercise 1

## Task 1: Install Python and an IDE of your choice
- Follow the installation steps mentioned in [Installing Python](../installation.md) for your operating system.
- Choose an IDE that you are comfortable with and set it up.

## Task 2: Write a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console
- Use the chosen IDE to create a new Python file.
- Write the `print("Hello, World!")` statement.
- Save and run the file to see the output in the console.

## Running the Program Using Terminal

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - On Windows, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - On macOS, press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter.
   - On Linux, open your preferred terminal emulator.

2. **Navigate to the Directory Containing Your Python File:**
   - Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if your file is on the section_1/hello_world:
     ```
     cd section_1/hello_world/
     ```

3. **Run the Python File:**
   - Type `python filename.py` (replace `filename.py` with the name of your file) and press Enter. If you are using Python 3, you might need to type `python3 filename.py`.
   - Example:
     ```
     python3 hello.py
     ```

4. **View the Output:**
   - You should see the output `Hello, World!` in the terminal.

### Example Session:
```
$ cd Desktop
$ python hello.py
Hello, World!
```

## Tips for Beginners
- **Readability**: Python emphasizes code readability, so use meaningful variable names and proper indentation.
- **Documentation**: Refer to the official Python documentation at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/) for detailed information and examples.
- **Practice**: The best way to learn programming is by writing and experimenting with code. Start with small projects and gradually take on more complex tasks.
- **Use Comments**: Use comments to explain what your code does. This helps you and others understand your code.
  ```python
  # This is a comment
  print("Hello, World!")  # This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console
  ```
- **Error Messages**: Don't be discouraged by error messages. They are helpful in understanding what went wrong. Read them carefully and try to understand the issue.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for variables and functions. For example, use `snake_case` for variables and functions (`my_variable`, `my_function()`).
- **Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Make sure to use consistent indentation (usually 4 spaces).
  ```python
  if True:
      print("This is indented correctly")
  ```
- **Ask for Help**: If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help. There are many online communities, such as Stack Overflow, where you can find answers and ask questions.
- **Explore Built-in Functions**: Python has many built-in functions that can save you time and effort. Familiarize yourself with them by reading the documentation or using the `help()` function in the interpreter.
  
  ```
  help(print)
  ```

By following these tips, you will build a solid foundation in Python programming.
