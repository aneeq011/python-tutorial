# Python Interpreter

## What is the Python Interpreter?
The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code interactively. It allows you to write Python code line by line and see the results immediately. This is useful for testing code snippets, learning Python, and debugging.

## Starting the Python Interpreter:
1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - On Windows, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - On macOS, press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter.
   - On Linux, open your preferred terminal emulator.

2. **Start the Interpreter:**
   - Type `python` or `python3` (depending on your installation) and press Enter.
   - You should see the Python prompt `>>>`.

## Using the Python Interpreter:
- You can now type Python code directly into the prompt.
- For example, type `print("Hello, World!")` and press Enter. You should see the output `Hello, World!`.
