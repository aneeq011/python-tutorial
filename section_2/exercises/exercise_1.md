# Practice Exercise 1

## Task 1: Understanding Variables and Data Types
- Review the concepts of variables and data types covered in `variables.md` and `data_types.md`.
- Create variables of different types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`) and perform operations on them.

## Task 2: Manipulating Strings and Lists
- Explore string operations (`strings.md`) and list operations (`lists.md`).
- Write code to concatenate strings, access elements in lists, and modify lists.

## Task 3: Exploring Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets
- Practice creating tuples, dictionaries, and sets as explained in their respective sections (`tuples.md`, `dictionaries.md`, `sets.md`).
- Perform operations like indexing tuples, accessing dictionary values, and using set operations.
