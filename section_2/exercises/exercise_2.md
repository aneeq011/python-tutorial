# Exercise 2: Basic Python Operations

## Task 1: Print Messages

1. Create a new Python file in your chosen IDE.
2. Write Python code to print the following messages to the console:
   - "Hello, World!"
   - "Python is fun!"
   - "I am learning Python."

## Task 2: Simple Calculations

   - Subtraction of two numbers: `10 - 7`
   - Multiplication of two numbers: `2 * 4`
   - Division of two numbers: `15 / 3`

## Task 3: Use of Variables

1. Declare variables to store the following data:
   - Store your name in a variable `name`.
   - Store your age in a variable `age`.
2. Print messages using these variables, such as:
   - "My name is [name]."
   - "I am [age] years old."

## Task 4: Concatenation of Strings

1. Create variables to store your first name and last name.
2. Concatenate them and print the full name.

## Task 5: Lists

1. Create a list `fruits` containing the names of three fruits.
2. Print each fruit in the list using a loop.

## Task 6: Simple Conditions
