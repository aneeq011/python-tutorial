# Variables in Python

Variables are used to store data values. In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them. This section covers the basics of variables and naming conventions.

## What are Variables?
- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- In Python, variables do not need to be declared with a specific data type and can change types after they have been set.

## Variable Naming Rules
- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- They cannot start with a number or contain spaces.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`my_var` is different from `My_Var`).

## Example:
```python
# Example of assigning variables
age = 25
name = "John"
is_student = True

# Printing variables
print(name)
print(age)
print(is_student)
```

By understanding variables, you can store and manipulate data effectively in Python.
