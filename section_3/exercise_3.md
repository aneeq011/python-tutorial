### Exercise: Sum of Even Numbers

Create a Python program that calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

#### Instructions:

1. Use a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 100.
2. Use an `if` statement to check if a number is even.
3. If the number is even, add it to a running total.
4. After the loop, print the total sum of all even numbers.

#### Tasks:

1. Implement the program in a Python file named `sum_even_numbers.py`.
2. Modify the program to calculate and print the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 100.
3. Modify the program to count and print the number of even numbers between 1 and 100.
4. Modify the program to find and print the largest even number between 1 and 100.
5. Modify the program to calculate and print the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 that are also multiples of 4.
